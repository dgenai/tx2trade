# tx2trade

## Abstract

This project provides a modular framework to **analyze Solana transactions** and reconstruct user-level **trading actions** (buy/sell).  
It abstracts away the complexity of raw instructions by applying a visitor/inference pipeline that outputs clear, auditable trade actions.  

---

## Architecture

At a high level, the pipeline has three layers:

1. **Instruction Parsing**  
   Transaction instructions are scanned and normalized into a unified representation called **TransferEdges**.  
   These edges capture token movements, authorities, and sequence ordering.

2. **Inference & Strategies**  
   A set of strategies interprets edges to infer **SwapLegs** (atomic trade legs).  
   Examples:
   - SOL bridging via wrapped SOL accounts  
   - Token-to-Token swaps  
   - Aggregator or market maker routing  

   Strategies are applied in a defined order for each pass. Any matching strategies consume edges to reconstruct swap legs. Subsequent strategies can still process the remaining edges. Iteration continues until no further legs are found or the maximum pass count is reached.

3. **Dust & Fees**  
   When reconstructing swap legs, small residual amounts (*dust*) and transaction fees must be taken into account.  
   - **Dust**: leftover token balances (e.g. a few lamports or token decimals) are ignored when inferring swap legs.  
   - **Fees**: network fees, rent-exempt account creation, and aggregator/AMM fees can slightly skew input/output balances.  
   
   These adjustments ensure strategies focus on the significant trade flows without being confused by minor discrepancies.

4. **Trade Action Synthesis**  
   Swap legs are finally converted into **TradeActions**:  
   - `buy` or `sell` relative to the user wallet  
   - With explicit amounts, token addresses, and the transaction hash  

This three-step model transforms raw blockchain data into actionable, structured insights.

## Components

- **Visitors**  
  - Parse Solana programs into normalized edges (e.g. SPL Token transfers, ATA creation).  
  - Easily extensible to support more programs.  

- **Strategies**
  - Apply domain heuristics to detect swaps, hubs, and routing patterns.
  - Encapsulate rules for Token-to-Token, SOL bridging, and aggregator-based flows.
  - Executed in a fixed priority order, in multiple passes, until no further legs can be reconstructed. 

- **Utilities**  
  - Helpers to detect WSOL hubs, correlate edges, and simplify transaction graph analysis.  

- **Converters**  
  - Produce high-level **TradeActions** from low-level legs, suitable for end users or reporting.

## Data Model

### TransferEdge
Represents a normalized movement of tokens within a transaction.

### SwapLeg
Represents one direction of a swap (sold â†’ bought).

### TradeAction
Final user-facing action (`buy` or `sell`), enriched with wallet, amounts, and token metadata.

---

## Example Workflow

1. Fetch one or more parsed transactions from Solana RPC.  
2. Build the **edges and account index** using the visitor framework.  
3. Run the strategy pipeline to infer **swap legs**.  
4. Convert swap legs into **trade actions**.  

Example output:

```json
[
  {
    "transactionHash": "4nUq...x3a",
    "transactionType": "buy",
    "walletAddress": "9abC...xyz",
    "sold": { "address": "So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112", "symbol": "SOL", "name": "Solana", "amount": 1.25 },
    "bought": { "address": "EcMzzinq67zZmxxxAcSSvCuRVfabdyE4jRMxxzqPgVfz", "symbol": "GAIN",  "name": "GAIN", "uri": "https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmUpgJo7a2uizgewvQa6iPGDr1jZrRhEGDumfKJE7ugFpC", "amount": 150.0 }
  }
]
```

## Usage

### CLI

```bash
RPC_ENDPOINT="https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com" \
tx2trade src/main.ts <TRANSACTION_SIGNATURE1> <TRANSACTION_SIGNATURE2> ...
tx2trade --help
```

### Library
```ts
import { tx2trade } from "tx2trade";

const actions = await tx2trade(signatures, process.env.RPC_ENDPOINT!, {
  debug: true,
  windowTotalFromOut: 500,
  requireAuthorityUserForOut: true,
});

console.log(actions);
```
