/**
 * TokenToWsolStrategy
 * -------------------
 * Reconstructs swap legs where the user sells a fungible token (non-WSOL) and receives WSOL.
 *
 * Core idea
 * - We match *by WSOL inflow*: for each WSOL credit into a user ATA, we search nearby
 *   (symmetrically if windowAroundIn is set) for the userâ€™s token debits (outs) that funded it.
 *
 * Windowing
 * - If `windowAroundIn` is provided, select outs with |seq(out) - seq(in)| <= windowAroundIn.
 * - Else, fall back to look-back only: out.seq < in.seq && (in.seq - out.seq) <= windowTotalFromOut.
 *
 * Tagging
 * - Edges tagged "fee" are excluded from OUT candidates. (Dust left to engine policy.)
 *
 * Modes
 * - aggregateOuts=false (default): pick the single largest qualifying token out.
 * - aggregateOuts=true : sum all qualifying outs in the window (recommended: same mint).
